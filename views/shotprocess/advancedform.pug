    p We have all had fliers. After confirming it isn't an arrow issue try one of the below.

    p The below are based on a right handed shooter. For lefties, it is the opposite.

            p Fligher rights can be a result of uneven push pull pressure

            h5 Keep pulling but hinge won't break
        .col(class="mb4 mx-4")
            h6 Reason:
            p You are pulling but your bow shoulder is creeping up.
            h6 Fixes:   
            p When drawing your bow keep your bow shoulder lower and focus on keeping your scapula down during the shot process. Try recording yourself during a shooting session to observe your bow shoulder. This often occurs at the end of a shooting session when fatigue is setting in. Another cause can be from your overall bow weight being too heavy.
